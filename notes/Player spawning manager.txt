array: all WR_PlayerDetectionTrigger's (Every town)
WR_RandomSpawnPoint: the single random spawn to act as a button on the map

OnPlayerSpawned()

- If spawn point is random spawn, do spawning logic from random town location
- Check if spawn point has parent that inherits from player detector trigger
- If not, return and let spawn happen directly on spawn point, must be special case
- If any other case, get spawn radius from parent trigger and pick random X and Z coords within (use weighted random numbers to bias towards the outside of the area)
- Get terrain Y coord at given X and Z, then perform a raycast down from 1 meter above.
- If raycast length is < 1, calculate new Y coord where the collision happened.
- Perform another raycast up 5 meters, if raycast length is < 1 go back and genereate new X and Z coords and try again since we must be inside.
- If upwards raycast hits nothing, we have a valid spawn location and the player's position can be set.
